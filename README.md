Brilliance! by Brooke Website

This will be the eCommerce website for Brilliance! by Brooke. It will consist of a landing page and others as needed....per Client requests. 

Day 2: Looking for images that would fit for this business. Waiting on owner to provide some copy, logo ideas, and images. 

    Still need to work on design / layout. Is Bootstrap the best option for this site? If this is an eCommerce site, should I amybe use Wordpress and WooCommerce? Need to firgure this out this week.
